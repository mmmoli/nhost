The GraphQL API is protected by a role-based permission system.

For each **role**, you create **rules** for the **select**, **insert**, **update**, and **delete** operations.

**Example:** Let's say you have a `posts` table, and you want users to only access their own posts. This is how you would do it:

```sql title="Posts Table"
CREATE TABLE "public"."posts" (
  "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "title" text NOT NULL,
  "user_id" uuid NOT NULL,
);
```

```json title="Hasura Permission Rule"
{
  "user_id": {
    "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
  }
}
```

The rule above make it so users can only select posts where the value of `user_id` is equal (`_eq`) to their user ID (`x-hasura-user-id`).

## What is `x-hasura-user-id`?

`x-hasura-user-id` is a permission variable that is used to create permission rules in Hasura. The permission variable comes from the [access token](platform/authentication#access-tokens) that signed-in users have.

The `x-hasura-user-id` permission variable is always available for all signed-in users. You can add [custom permission variables](#custom-permission-variables) to create more complex permission rules unique to your project.

## Custom Permission Variables

You can add custom permission variables in the Nhost console under **Users** and then **Roles and permissions**. These permission variables are then available when creating permissions for your GraphQL API in the Hasura console.

**Example:**: Let's say you add a new permission variable `x-hasura-organisation-id` with path `user.profile.organisation.id`. This means that Nhost Auth will get the value for `x-hasura-organisation-id` by internally generating the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "<User's ID>") {
    profile {
      organisation {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Custom Permission Variables

To use custom permission variables locally, add your claims to the `config.yml` as following:

```
auth:
  custom_claims: '{"organisation-id":"profile.organisation.id"}'
```

Your custom claim will be automatically prefixed with `x-hasura-`, therefore, the example above results in a custom permission variable named `x-hasura-organisation-id`. View your new Custom Permission Variable by [decoding the jwt token online](https://jwt-decoder.com/). 

## Roles

Every GraphQL request is resolved based on a **single role**. Roles are added in the Hasura Console when selecting a table and clicking **Permisisons**.

If the user is not signed in, the GraphQL API resolves permissions using the `public` role.

### Default Role

Every user have one **default role**. The default role is used to resolve permissions if no other role is specified using the `x-hasura-role` header in the GraphQL request. By default, the default role is `user` for signed-in users.

### Allowed Roles

Every user also has a one or more **allowed roles**. Allowed roles are roles that the user is allowed to use to override the default role when making a GraphQL request. To override the default role, add a header `x-hasura-role = <role>` to the GraphQL request.

## Public Access

GraphQL requests from unauthenticated users are resolved using the `public` role.

## Insert permissions

![Insert permissions](/img/graphql/permissions/insert-permissions.png)

Here is a popular approach for insert permission for signed-in users.

1. At the top of the page, click **"insert"** on the **"user"** role.
2. Select **"Without any checks"**.
3. Select the columns you want to allow users to insert.

In our example, we only mark `title`, because the other columns should not be inserted by the user.

We also want every new record's `user_id` value to be set to the ID of the user making the request. We can tell Hasura to do this using **Column presets**.

4. Under **Column presets**, set `user_id` to `x-hasura-user-id`.

Now, users who are signed-in can insert posts. Users can add a title when inserting a post. The post's `id` is automatically generated by the database and the `user_id` is automatically set to the user's id using the `user_id = x-hasura-user-id` column preset.

## Select, Update and Delete Permissions

Select, update, and delete permissions usually follows the same pattern. Here's an example of how to add select permissions:

![Select permissions](/img/platform/permission-select.png)

One of the most common permission requirements is that signed-in users should only be able to read their own data. This is how to do that:

1. Go to **Hasura Console**
1. Select your table and open the **Permissions** tab
1. At the top of the page, click **"select"** on the **"user"** role.
1. Select **"With custom check"** to create a new rule
1. Enter `user_id`, `_eq` and `x-hasura-user-id` into the rule form.

This means that in order for users to read data, the user ID value in the database row must be the same as the user ID in the access token.

To further refine this rule, do the following:

1. Limit number of rows to 100 (or some other relevant number).
1. Select the columns you want the user to be able to read. In our case we'll allow the user to read all columns.

Note that if you add columns to your table table later, you must check new columns here to let users read them.
